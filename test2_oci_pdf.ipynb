JSON data type is supported as a column type in the external table definition. Newline- delimited and JSON-array file options are supported, which facilitates importing JSON data from an external table. This feature makes it easier to load data into a JSON-type columns. Related Resources View Documentation JSON/JSON_VALUE will Convert PL/SQL Aggregate Type to/from JSON The PL/SQL JSON constructor is enhanced to accept an instance of a corresponding PL/SQL aggregate type, returning a JSON object or array type populated with the aggregate type data. The PL/SQL JSON_VALUE operator is enhanced so that its returning clause can accept a type name that defines the type of the instance that the operator is to return. JSON constructor support for aggregate data types streamlines data interchange between PL/SQL applications and languages that support JSON. Related Resources View Documentation JSON_ARRAY Constructor by Query A subquery can be used as an argument to SQL/JSON function JSON_ARRAY to define the array elements. This functionality is part of the SQL/JSON standard. This feature increases your developer productivity and higher interoperability with other SQL/ JSON standard-compliant solutions. Related Resources View Documentation JSON_EXPRESSION_CHECK Parameter A new parameter JSON_EXPRESSION_CHECK  allows to enable/disable a JSON query check. The values are on and off. The default is off. For now, this parameter is limited to JSON- relational duality views. An error is raised if a JSON path expression on a duality view does not match to an underlying column, for example if the path expression has a typo. The error is raised during query compilations. This simplifies working with JSON-relational duality views, as incorrect JSON path expressions do not need to be debugged at runtime but instead are flagged at query'"

      "1 Introduction Oracle Database 23c is the next long term support release of Oracle Database. Oracle Database 23c, code named “App Simple,”  accelerates Oracle's mission to make it simple to develop and run all data-driven applications. It's the sum of all the features from the Oracle Database 21c innovation release plus over 300 new features and enhancements. Key focus areas include JSON, graph, microservices, and developer productivity. Note: For information about desupported features, see Oracle Database Changes, Desupports, and Deprecations. JSON Relational Duality Data can be transparently accessed and updated as either JSON documents or relational tables. Developers benefit from the strengths of both, which are simpler and more powerful than Object Relational Mapping (ORM). See JSON-Relational Duality . Operational Property Graphs in SQL Developers can now build real-time graph analysis applications against operational data directly in the Oracle Database, utilizing its industry leading security, high availability and performance capabilities. See Support for the ISO/IEC SQL Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ) Standard . Microservice Support Alongside Oracle’s already comprehensive support for microservices, new functionality makes it simpler to implement cross-service transactions. See Microservices . Lock-Free Column Value Reservations Lock-free column value reservations allow applications to reserve part of a value in a column without locking the row; for example, reserve part of a bank account balance or reserve an item in inventory without locking out all other operations on the bank account or item. See Lock-Free Reservations . 1-1\n",
