# Integrate OCI Generative AI with LangChain
This repo contains all the work done to develop demos on the integration between [**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com/) and Oracle [**OCI GenAI**](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/large-language-models/) Service.

## OCI Generative AI Service is in Limited Availability
Consider that OCI Generative AI Service (based on Cohere models) is now (oct. 2023) in **Limited 
Availability**.

It means that:
* to test this code you need to apply for the LA
* During the LA there could be breaking changes, in the OCI SDK or in the signature of the service.

I'll try to keep the code updated.

## Documentation
The development of the proposed integration is based on the example, from LangChain, provided [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms/custom_llm)
