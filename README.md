# Integrate OCI GenAI with LangChain
This repo contains all the work done to develop demos on the integration between **LangChain** and Oracle **OCI GenAI** Service

## OCI GenAI Service is in Limited Availability
Consider that OCI GenAI Service (based on Cohere models) is now (oct. 2023) in **Limited Availability**.

It means that:
* to test this code you need to apply for the LA
* During the LA there could be breaking changes, in the OCI SDK or in the signature of the service.

I'll try to keep the code updated.

## Documentation
The development of the proposed integration is based on the example, from LangChain, provided [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms/custom_llm)
